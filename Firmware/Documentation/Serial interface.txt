Elsidi serial interface
-----------------------

Each received character is sent to active LCD and then echoed back.


Escape characters

    Escape characters are in ASCII range 0x08-0x0F (8-15 decimal). This range
    was selected since only CGRAM characters are here and they can be selected
    within 0x00-0x07 range. Here is meaning of escape characters:
      0x08 BS  Command mode.
      0x09 HT  Next line.
      0x0A LF  Return home.
      0x0B VT  Reserved for future use.
      0x0C FF  Instruction mode.
      0x0D CR  Return home.
      0x0E SO  Select secondary display.
      0x0F SI  Select primary display.    

    In order to ease manual data entry across different systems both <LF> and
    <CR> will result in same action.

    BS: Command mode

        Upon receiving <BS> Elsidi will enter in command mode until <LF> is
        received. If command execution was successful it will echo <LF>,
        otherwise <BS> will be echoed.

        ~ (defaults)

            Returns backlight and contrast to default values. They are also
            written to be used upon next boot.

        b___ (backlight)

            Letter <b> is followed by percent amount in decimal digits. Given
            value is set as backlight until Elsidi loses power.

        B___ (backlight write)

            Letter <B> is followed by percent amount in decimal digits. Given
            value is written in flash and it will be used upon next boot.

        c___ (contrast)

            Letter <c> is followed by percent amount in decimal digits. Given
            value is set as contrast until Elsidi loses power.

        C___ (contrast write)

            Letter <C> is followed by percent amount in decimal digits. Given
            value is written in flash and it will be used upon next boot.

    HT: Next line

      Moves LCD cursor to next line. It is included as helper method for
      controlling display from command line. Display is always considered as
      having four lines and stops will be at locations: 0x00 (first line), 0x40
      (second line), 0x14 (third line) and 0x54 (fourth line). After fourth
      line no movement will be made until line is resetted (via CR command).

    LF: Return home

      Executes Return home LCD instruction. Result will be same as <FF> 0x02
      was executed. It is included as helper method for controlling display
      from command line. This command will also reset tab position back to
      first line.

    FF: Instruction mode

      Causes character that follows to be interpreted as direct instruction for
      LCD. Next character will be sent to LCD with RS signal kept low. E.g.,
      <FF> 0x02 will cause LCD to execute Return home command. After
      instruction character, all further characters are interpreted as usual.

    CR: Return home

      Executes Return home LCD instruction. Result will be same as <FF> 0x02
      was executed. It is included as helper method for controlling display
      from command line. This command will also reset tab position back to
      first line.

    SO: Select secondary display

      Characters after this one will cause E2 line to be driven and thus
      secondary display will receive all input. This command must be used for
      each execution since primary display will be used by default upon each
      boot.

    SI: Select primary display

      All further characters are executed via driving E1 line and thus
      controling primary display. 


Examples

    Basic write

        Send ..: Line 1
        Receive: Line 1
        Result : Writes "Line 1" on display.

    Two line write

        Send ..: Line 1<HT>Line 2
        Receive: Line 1<HT>Line 2
        Result : Writes "Line 1" on first line and "Line 2" on second.

    Return home

        Send ..: <LF>
        Receive: <LF>
        Result : Cursor is set in left-top location.

    Clear display

        Send ..: <BS><LF>
        Receive: <LF>
        Result : Clears display.

    Contrast 

        Send ..: <BS>C90<LF>
        Receive: <LF>
        Result : Set contrast to 90%.

    Backlight

        Send ..: <BS>B10<LF>
        Receive: <LF>
        Result : Sets backlight to 10%.

     Restore defaults

        Send ..: <BS>~<LF>
        Receive: <LF>
        Result : Sets contrast to 90% and backlight to 0%.

    Secondary display

        Send ..: <SO>Line 1<SI>Line A
        Receive: <SO>Line 1<SI>Line A
        Result : Writes "Line 1" to secondary display and "Line A" to primary.
