EXPLANATIONS

  o This board supports 5V TTL USART connection. Pin order is [GND 5V RX TX] as
    viewed from board side.

  o Backlight intensity is controled via PWM.

  o This board features two display connectors. Idea is to allow for easier
    soldering. In most cases both display connectors should not be soldered on. 


LCD INTERFACE

  Elsidi uses total of 11 control lines for sending text and instructions to
  LCD these lines are:
    
    RS       Selects registers.
    R/W      Selects read or write.
    E        Starts data read/write.
    DB0-DB3  Four low order bidirectional tristate data bus pins.
    DB4-DB7  Four high order bidirectional tristate data bus pins.

  All lines except for E are multiplexed between two supported LCD devices. E
  is controled separately for primary (E1) and secondary LCD display (E2). Only
  one display can be controlled at any time.

  Currently all 8 data lines are used for controlling LCD.


USART INTERFACE

  Hardware interface

    Three wires are used - RXD, TXD and GND. All data is sent in ASCII at 9600
    baud, 1 stop bit and no parity.

  Command characters
    
    Command characters are in ASCII range 0x08-0x0F (8-15 decimal). This range
    was selected since only CGRAM characters are here and they can be selected
    within 0x00-0x07 range.

    Each command will result in either <LF> in case of success or it's own
    character in case of failure.    


    Return home (BS)

      Executes Return home LCD instruction. Result will be same as <FF> 0x02
      was executed on both displays.

    Command mode (HT)

      Elsidi is in command mode. Command follows pattern <HT> <command>
      [<data0> ... <dataN>] <LF>.

    Next line (LF/CR)

      Moves LCD cursor to next line. In case of normal display its locations
      will be 0x00, 0x40, 0x14 and 0x54. In case of double display (e.g. 40x4)
      stops will be at 0x00, 0x40, 0x00 (second controller), 0x40 (second
      controller). After fourth line is selected command will perform no action
      until Clear display is executed.

    Clear display (VT)

      Executes Clear display LCD instruction. Result will be same as <FF> 0x01
      was executed on both displays.

    LCD instruction mode (FF)

      Causes character that follows to be interpreted as direct instruction for
      LCD. Next character will be sent to LCD with RS signal kept low. E.g.,
      <FF> 0x02 will cause LCD to execute Return home command. After
      instruction character, all further characters are interpreted as usual.

    Select secondary display (SO)
        
      Characters after this one will cause E2 line to be driven and thus
      secondary display will receive all input. This command must be used for
      each execution since primary display will be used by default.

    Select primary display (SI)
        
      All further characters are executed via driving E1 line and thus
      controling primary display.
