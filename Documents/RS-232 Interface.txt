Lcd232 interface

Hardware interface
------------------
Four wires are used - RXD, TXD, CTS and GND. All data is sent in ASCII
at 9600 baud, 1 stop bit and no parity. Although DTR and RTS lines are
not used, for compatibility with future versions one must make them
active before anything is sent to device!

Reserved characters
-------------------
Reserved characters are in ASCII range 0x08-0x0F (8-15 decimal). This
range was selected since only CGRAM characters are here and they can be
selected within 0x00-0x07 range. Here is meaning of characters:
    0x08 BS   Reserved for future use.
    0x09 HT   Reserved for future use.
    0x0A LF   Executes content of buffer.
    0x0B VT   Reserved for future use.
    0x0C FF   Reserved for future use.
    0x0D CR   Reserved for future use.
    0x0E SO   Activates LCD instruction mode for next character.
    0x0F SI   Next character is to be taken as literal - not yet
              implemented.

Default mode
------------
All characters received are saved in buffer without echoing to computer.
To temporary enter LCD instruction mode for next character SO has to be
used. When LF is detected, execution of buffer is triggered. After
execution is done LF is sent back to computer, state returns to text
mode and buffer is ready to receive new characters. If buffer size
(208 bytes) is exceeded all further characters except LF are ignored.

Execution (LF)
--------------
Buffer is executed when LF is detected. During execution no further
input is received. When execution is done LF will be sent back to
computer.

LCD instruction mode (SO)
-------------------------
When in LCD instruction mode received character is saved exactly as
received. Reserved characters can also be used in this mode. After
character is received parser returns in text mode.

Literal character (SI)
----------------------
Character after this one will be taken as literal and sent to LCD module
as text. It needs to be used for sending characters in reserved range
(0x08-0x0F).

LCD startup sequence
--------------------
Startup sequence is executed each time hardware is restarted. It is
defined within device's EEPROM as normal serial line characters and it
ends with LF. No output will be generated after this execution. One can
check whether startup is done by checking CTS line.

Clear To Send (CTS)
-------------------
Line is high when module is ready to receive commands from computer.
During execution and startup phase, CTS is down.
